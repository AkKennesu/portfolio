This dashboard was developed as part of our quiz game to enable instructors to monitor student progress and performance in real time. It is powered by Firebase as the primary database, providing secure and efficient data management between the game and the dashboard. Teacher accounts are manually managed by the developers to maintain system security, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that only verified instructors can create and manage classes. This approach enhances both data integrity and overall platform security.
