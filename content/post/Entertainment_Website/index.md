This project was developed as part of our Web Development course â€” a comprehensive, 100-page front-end entertainment website built using HTML5, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript. The site features a responsive design, dynamic components, and an engaging user interface aimed at delivering an interactive browsing experience
