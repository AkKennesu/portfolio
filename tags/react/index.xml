It uses Firebase to connect and synchronize data with the game, ensuring seamless integration between both platforms. The site highlights the gameâ€™s key features, provides an overview of the gameplay experience, and offers users the option to download the mobile app. Both the website and the mobile application are currently under active development, with continuous improvements being made to enhance functionality and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dashboard</title><link>https://AkKennesu.github.io/portfolio/p/dashboard/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 06:33:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AkKennesu.github.io/portfolio/p/dashboard/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://AkKennesu.github.io/portfolio/p/dashboard/dashboard.png" alt="Featured image of post Dashboard" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dashboard was developed as part of our quiz game to enable instructors to monitor student progress and performance in real time. It is powered by Firebase as the primary database, providing secure and efficient data management between the game and the dashboard. Teacher accounts are manually managed by the developers to maintain system security, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that only verified instructors can create and manage classes. This approach enhances both data integrity and overall platform security.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
