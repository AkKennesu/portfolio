This Discord bot was developed to provide music playback functionality within voice channels. It utilizes the YouTube API to stream audio directly in Voice Chat and supports Spotify links by converting track titles into searchable YouTube queries for playback. Additionally, the bot integrates the Tenor API to search and share GIFs within chats, enhancing user interaction and engagement.
