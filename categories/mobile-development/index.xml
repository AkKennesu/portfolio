The goal was simple — to help students catch up on lessons while having fun at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was built using Unity Hub, Firebase, and C#, combining smooth gameplay with reliable data management and multiplayer capabilities. One of its key features is its flexibility — it can be played both offline and online. In online mode, students can connect, play, and compete with their friends or classmates, fostering collaboration and a sense of friendly competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project allowed me to explore game-based learning as a creative way to make studying more engaging, while also strengthening my skills in game development, UI design, and real-time data integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
