As part of my journey as an IT student, I developed an educational quiz game designed to make learning more interactive and enjoyable for BSIT students. The goal was simple — to help students catch up on lessons while having fun at the same time.

The game was built using Unity Hub, Firebase, and C#, combining smooth gameplay with reliable data management and multiplayer capabilities. One of its key features is its flexibility — it can be played both offline and online. In online mode, students can connect, play, and compete with their friends or classmates, fostering collaboration and a sense of friendly competition.

This project allowed me to explore game-based learning as a creative way to make studying more engaging, while also strengthening my skills in game development, UI design, and real-time data integration.
