It uses Firebase to connect and synchronize data with the game, ensuring seamless integration between both platforms. The site highlights the game’s key features, provides an overview of the gameplay experience, and offers users the option to download the mobile app. Both the website and the mobile application are currently under active development, with continuous improvements being made to enhance functionality and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Dashboard</title><link>https://AkKennesu.github.io/portfolio/p/dashboard/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 06:33:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AkKennesu.github.io/portfolio/p/dashboard/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://AkKennesu.github.io/portfolio/p/dashboard/dashboard.png" alt="Featured image of post Dashboard" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dashboard was developed as part of our quiz game to enable instructors to monitor student progress and performance in real time. It is powered by Firebase as the primary database, providing secure and efficient data management between the game and the dashboard. Teacher accounts are manually managed by the developers to maintain system security, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that only verified instructors can create and manage classes. This approach enhances both data integrity and overall platform security.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Android_quiz_game</title><link>https://AkKennesu.github.io/portfolio/p/android_quiz_game/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 04:48:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AkKennesu.github.io/portfolio/p/android_quiz_game/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://AkKennesu.github.io/portfolio/p/android_quiz_game/game_screenshot.png" alt="Featured image of post Android_quiz_game" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of my journey as an IT student, I developed an educational quiz game designed to make learning more interactive and enjoyable for BSIT students. The goal was simple — to help students catch up on lessons while having fun at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was built using Unity Hub, Firebase, and C#, combining smooth gameplay with reliable data management and multiplayer capabilities. One of its key features is its flexibility — it can be played both offline and online. In online mode, students can connect, play, and compete with their friends or classmates, fostering collaboration and a sense of friendly competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project allowed me to explore game-based learning as a creative way to make studying more engaging, while also strengthening my skills in game development, UI design, and real-time data integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
