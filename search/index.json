The goal was simple — to help students catch up on lessons while having fun at the same time.\nThe game was built using Unity Hub, Firebase, and C#, combining smooth gameplay with reliable data management and multiplayer capabilities. One of its key features is its flexibility — it can be played both offline and online. In online mode, students can connect, play, and compete with their friends or classmates, fostering collaboration and a sense of friendly competition.\nThis project allowed me to explore game-based learning as a creative way to make studying more engaging, while also strengthening my skills in game development, UI design, and real-time data integration.\n","date":"2025-02-24T04:48:21Z","image":"https://AkKennesu.github.io/portfolio/p/android_quiz_game/game_screenshot_hu_90d531929b7d1ea1.png","permalink":"https://AkKennesu.github.io/portfolio/p/android_quiz_game/","title":"Android_quiz_game"},{"content":"This is my personal portfolio, designed and built using Hugo.
